# PyProxyRoulette
The pyproxyroulette library provides a wrapper for python [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/). It takes care of randomly selecting proxys and swapping them out to when needed. Additionally it ensures, that the proxy is working corrctly.

## Usage
```python
from pyproxyroulette import ProxyRoulette
req = ProxyRoulette()
req.get("http://github.com")
```
